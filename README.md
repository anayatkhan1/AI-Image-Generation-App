# Introduction!

This is an AI-powered image generation application built using React, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, the DAlleApi, and the Cloudinary API for hosting images. 
The application leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to generate unique and creative images based on user inputs or specific criteria.

 # Features
 
- Image Generation: The app utilizes cutting-edge AI algorithms to generate visually appealing images based on various parameters. Users can customize the style, color palette, content, and other parameters to generate images tailored to their preferences.
 
- User-friendly Interface: The app features a sleek and intuitive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS, providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

- Image Gallery: Generated images are stored in a Showcase, allowing users to view and manage their creations easily. Users can also learn from others prompt and download their images directly from the gallery.

# Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-built styles and components for rapid development.
  
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
  
- DAlleApi: An AI-based API for generating images based on user-defined parameters.
  
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing user-generated images.
  
- Cloudinary API: A cloud-based image hosting service that provides secure storage and fast delivery of images.

  # Contribution Guide

- Fork the repository, create a clone and make sure that you are not working on the `MAIN BRANCH' repository!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username-here}/AI-Image-Generation-App.git
```

```bash
cd dalle
```

- It is not good practice to work on the `main` branch. You can create a new branch by using this command

```bash
git checkout -b {name-of-the-branch-here}
```

- Add a stream so you can sync your clone with the original repository (get the latest updates)

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/anayatkhan1/AI-Image-Generation-App.git
```

- Use this command to stay up to date with the original repository (not the fork that you made)

```bash
git pull upstream master
```

- Make your contribution too :)

- Open a Pull Request also.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
